# Autosave tool

## Purpose

This tool automatically adds, commits and pushes changed files to your repository. It is meant to use for document tracking or in other cases when commit messages and branching are not so relevant.

## Prerequisites

- GIT repository set up for the folder to be *autosaved* [see](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo)
